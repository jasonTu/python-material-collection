In fact, the standard sequences also implement \\__iter__, and yours should too, because the special handling of \\__getitem__ exists for backward compatibility reasons and may be gone in the future (although it is not deprecated as I write this).\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in “Python Digs Sequences” on page 310, this is an extreme form of duck typing: an object is considered iterable not only when it implements the special method \\__iter__, but also when it implements \\__getitem__, as long as \\__getitem__ accepts int keys starting from 0.\n",

    "yield from i replaces the inner for loop completely. The use of yield from in this example is correct, and the code reads better, but it seems like mere syntactic sugar. Besides replacing a loop, yield from creates a channel connecting the inner generator directly to the client of the outer generator. This channel becomes really im‐ portant when generators are used as coroutines and not only produce but also consume values from the client code. Chapter 16 dives into coroutines, and has several pages explaining why yield from is much more than syntactic sugar."

    "## Generator as Coroutines\n",

In other words, .send() allows two-way data exchange be‐ tween the client code and the generator—in contrast with .\\__next__(), which only lets the client receive data from the generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is such a major “enhancement” that it actually changes the nature of generators: when used in this way, they become coroutines. David Beazley—probably the most pro‐ lific writer and speaker about coroutines in the Python community—warned in a fa‐ mous PyCon US 2009 tutorial:\n",
