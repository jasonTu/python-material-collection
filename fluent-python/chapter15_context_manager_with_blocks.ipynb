    "## Do This, Then That: else Blocks Beyond if\n",
    "This is no secret, but it is an underappreciated language feature: the else clause can be used not only in if statements but also in for, while, and try statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantics of for/else, while/else, and try/else are closely related, but very different from if/else. Initially the word else actually hindered my understanding of these features, but eventually I got used to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the rules:\n",
    "* for\n",
    "\n",
    "The else block will run only if and when the for loop runs to completion (i.e., not if the for is aborted with a break).\n",
    "\n",
    "* while\n",
    "\n",
    "The else block will run only if and when the while loop exits because the condition became falsy (i.e., not when the while is aborted with a break).\n",
    "* try\n",
    "\n",
    "The else block will only run if no exception is raised in the try block. The official docs also state: “Exceptions in the else clause are not handled by the preceding except clauses.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, the else clause is also skipped if an exception or a return, break, or continue statement causes control to jump out of the main block of the compound statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in my_list:\n",
    "    if item.flavor == 'banana':\n",
    "        break\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    raise ValueError('No banana flavor found!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of try/except blocks, else may seem redundant at first. After all, the after_call() in the following snippet will run only if the dangerous_call() does not raise an exception, correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    dangerous_call()\n",
    "    after_call()\n",
    "except OSError:\n",
    "    log('OSError...')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, doing so puts the after_call() inside the try block for no good reason. For clarity and correctness, the body of a try block should only have the statements that may generate the expected exceptions. This is much better:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    dangerous_call()\n",
    "except OSError:\n",
    "    log('OSError...')\n",

    "## Context Managers and with Blocks\n",
    "Context manager objects exist to control a with statement, just like iterators exist to control a for statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The with statement was designed to simplify the try/finally pattern, which guarantees that some operation is performed after a block of code, even if the block is aborted because of an exception, a return or sys.exit() call. The code in the finally clause usually releases a critical resource or restores some previous state that was temporarily changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The context manager protocol consists of the \\__enter__ and \\__exit__ methods. At the start of the with, \\__enter__ is invoked on the context manager object. The role of the finally clause is played by a call to \\__exit__ on the context manager object at the end of the with block.\n",

    "A function to build context managers out of objects that provide a close() method but don’t implement the \\__enter__/\\__exit__ protocol.\n",

    "* suppress\n",
    "\n",
    "A context manager to temporarily ignore specified exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* @contextmanager\n",
    "\n",
    "A decorator that lets you build a context manager from a simple generator function, instead of creating a class and implementing the protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ContextDecorator\n",
    "\n",
    "A base class for defining class-based context managers that can also be used as function decorators, running the entire function within a managed context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ExitStack\n",
    "\n",
    "A context manager that lets you enter a variable number of context managers. When the with block ends, ExitStack calls the stacked context managers’ \\__exit__ methods in LIFO order (last entered, first exited). Use this class when you don’t know beforehand how many context managers you need to enter in your with block; for example, when opening all files from an arbitrary list of files at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most widely used of these utilities is surely the @contextmanager decorator, so it deserves more attention. That decorator is also intriguing because it shows a use for the yield statement unrelated to iteration. This paves the way to the concept of a coroutine, the theme of the next chapter."

    "In a generator decorated with @contextmanager, yield is used to split the body of the function in two parts: everything before the yield will be executed at the beginning of the while block when the interpreter calls \\__enter__; the code after yield will run when \\__exit__ is called at the end of the block."
