    "## Operator Overloading 101\n",
    "Operator overloading has a bad name in some circles. It is a language feature that can be (and has been) abused, resulting in programmer confusion, bugs, and unexpected performance bottlenecks. But if well used, it leads to pleasurable APIs and readable code. Python strikes a good balance between flexibility, usability, and safety by imposing some limitations:\n",
    "* We cannot overload operators for the built-in types.\n",
    "* We cannot create new operators, only overload existing ones.\n",
    "* A few operators can’t be overloaded: is, and, or, not (but the bitwise &, |, ~, can)."

    "## Unary Operators\n",
    "In The Python Language Reference, “6.5. Unary arithmetic and bitwise operations” lists three unary operators, shown here with their associated special methods:\n",
    "* \\- (\\__neg__)\n",
    "Arithmetic unary negation. If x is -2 then -x == 2.\n",
    "* \\+ (\\__pos__)\n",
    "Arithmetic unary plus. Usually x == +x, but there are a few cases when that’s not true. See “When x and +x Are Not Equal” on page 373 if you’re curious.\n",
    "* \\~ (\\__invert__)\n",
    "Bitwise inverse of an integer, defined as ~x == -(x+1). If x is 2 then ~x == -3.\n",
    "The Data Model” chapter of The Python Language Reference also lists the abs(...) built- in function as a unary operator. The associated special method is \\__abs__, as we’ve seen before, starting with “Emulating Numeric Types” on page 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s easy to support the unary operators. Simply implement the appropriate special method, which will receive just one argument: self. Use whatever logic makes sense in your class, but stick to the fundamental rule of operators: always return a new object. In other words, do not modify self, but create and return a new instance of a suitable type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of - and +, the result will probably be an instance of the same class as self; for +, returning a copy of self is the best approach most of the time. For abs(...), the result should be a scalar number. As for ~, it’s difficult to say what would be a sensible result if you’re not dealing with bits in an integer, but in an ORM it could make sense to return the negation of an SQL WHERE clause, for example."
